## Content


Well, this marks the end of my freedom project for my Junior year in my software engineering program. It has been a journey to say the least, from just adding kaboom to my ide and now having a fully functioning game, I'm proud of myself for learning what I have and doing what I have done. I have completed my project, made my presentation, presented in front of my class as well as in front of judges at my school's SEP EXPO. I haven't presented in a while so I was quite nervous about these even with preparation.


The first thing I needed to do was make my presentation slides. While creating the slides I wanted to make them simplistic and eye-catching at the same time. I used a template just to have a nice background and after that was time to add the information. I added a ton of images in order to keep it straight to the point and I knew that I would be able to explain with words what each image shows. I needed a creative way to end my presentation, however I wasn't sure what exactly I could have done. After some thought I remembered that since I have to explain my takeaways from this project I could just take each letter of "kaboom" and add a takeaway for each letter. It took some brainstorming for I knew what I had learned yet I didn't know how to word it so that each takeaway would start with a specific letter however after some time I got it. When I presented I knew that I would be nervous yet when I actually took a look out and saw everyone's eyes on me I kind of panicked for a second. I did go off script for a bit however it ended up going alright. I learned that no matter how much you prepare for something, you can never be 100 percent prepared. I thought I was alright, but actually doing the presentation was scarier than I thought. I learned that I have to be okay with adapting to what I am given and how I am feeling and accept things might not always go according to plan.


Then came the EXPO where I would present to other Students as well as teachers and judges. I planned out my pitch for the judges yet when it came to presenting to other students I didn't have a plan and just showed them that I'm just a student who completed a project and made a fun little game. I didn't want to have people come up to me and give them a minute presentation because I wanted to have conversations with them and show them what I made. I wanted those interactions to be friendly and casual. It was a fun experience as I enjoyed seeing what others made with my friends and it was a nice way to end the year. What I took away from the EXPO is that showing your human side is a great thing because it can help others show their true personality. In return for showing everyone who I really am when I'm not trying to be professional, they showed me their fun unprofessional side as well and it was enjoyable to see their personalities shine.


## EDP


In the Engineering Design Process I have completed the final step, step 8, which is to communicate the results. I have now shown everyone what I have made and I am very happy with how it turned out. Over the course of the last year, I have learned a lot about myself and coding, but mainly myself. I am scared because I feel that I have made a lot of progress and I'm afraid I might not be able to keep this momentum going for I feel burnt out to some degree. This summer I intend to relax a bit, reset myself, have some fun, and hopefully be able to hit the ground running my senior year and restart the Engineering Design process for my next freedom project for whatever it might be.


## Skills


The skills I have been working on for the end of my freedom project is time management as well as creativity. To complete the slides for my presentation in time I needed to work on it throughout a few days and because I did that the presentation ended up being presentable. I also had to plan out time to attempt to practice how I would present my slides and what I wanted to say and how I wanted to say it. To make my slides I also had to work on my creativity to make it look eye-catching as well as figuring out how to end it off. Taking each letter of "kaboom" and turning it into a takeaway was a great way to end my presentation yet I needed to think creatively to figure that out. This project has been quite the experience and I am truly thankful and proud for how everything turned out.
