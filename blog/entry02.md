### Content
In the past month or so, I have been tinkering and trying to learn more about Kaboom. This has been definetly a new experience and something very different from what I am used to. I looked at a bunch of different componants of kaboom and tried different things to switch it up. For instance, one way I was tinkering was playing around with the width an height of the screen. I reaized that the change of `height` would effect how tall the screen would be and the `width` changed how wide the screen would be. 

```js
kaboom({
	// without specifying "width" and "height", kaboom will size to the container (document.body by default)
	width: 200,
	height: 200,
	// "stretch" stretches the defined width and height to fullscreen
	// stretch: true,
	// "letterbox" makes stretching keeps aspect ratio (leaves black bars on empty spaces), have no effect without "stretch"
	letterbox: true,
})
```
