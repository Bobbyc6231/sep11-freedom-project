### Content
In the past month or so, I have been tinkering and trying to learn more about Kaboom. This has been definetly a new experience and something very different from what I am used to. I looked at a bunch of different componants of kaboom and tried different things to switch it up. For instance, one way I was tinkering was playing around with the width an height of the screen. I reaized that the change of `height` would effect how tall the screen would be and the `width` changed how wide the screen would be. 

```js
kaboom({
	// without specifying "width" and "height", kaboom will size to the container (document.body by default)
	width: 200,
	height: 200,
	// "stretch" stretches the defined width and height to fullscreen
	// stretch: true,
	// "letterbox" makes stretching keeps aspect ratio (leaves black bars on empty spaces), have no effect without "stretch"
	letterbox: true,
})
```

### Engineering Design Process
In the Engineering Design Process, I am currently in steps 2 and 3 which is research and brainstorming. Throughout the time of my tinkering I have been researching different things and trying new things that I could potentially add to my future game. Researching hasn't been as bad as I first thought it would be. For me in this whole process so far, I think that the hardest part has been the beginning when I was first getting started because I didn't have any clue where to begin. When I first was lost, I started to do the small things, changing small bits of code and whenever it would work the way I thought it might I would genuinely be shocked. While changing different things I would also be brainstorming which parts I would like to add to my game and what I don't necessarlly need. An example pf this when I was tinkering with designing the levels, I knew I would need to have that in my future game, yet when I was tinkering with the `offscreen` code I knew I wasn't going to use it in my freedom project.
