- worked with the code on kaboom.js, worked with movement
- changed speed (speed) to negative speed (-speed) which made it move in opposite direction
- Made me come up with the idea to create a challenge where you have to press the opposite key to go in the direction you want

- Worked with the gravity code
- Learned the higher the number, the less time it takes for the sprite to fall
- the smaller the number, the less gravity that is applied to the sprite and it kinda floats
