# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Bobby Chan


## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.


For my project, I chose to independently study [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/ ) in order to help me make a game where a sprite has to collect a certain amount of something while avoiding obstacles to win.

## Implications


##### PROS


* Anyone is able to play all across the world
* Demonstrates to others that anyone is capable of learning how to code for I started with no knowledge
* Creating games is a part of a great selection of careers
* Provides entertainment for all ages
* Brings nostalgic feeling as it uses concepts from popular games and modern game culture


##### CONS
* It is one game and it is either win or lose and nothing much else
* There are glitches that occur within the game that causes the sprites to fall
* At times the page needs to be reset due to glitches making the game unplayable




## Blog / Content
Below you will find my blog entries throughout the year about how I made my project. Each blog entry explains how I tinkered with Kaboom over short periods of time and what I did with it in order to get the product I now have.
